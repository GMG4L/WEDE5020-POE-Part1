# WEDE5020-POE-Part
The Topic I have chosen is to make a website for a Non profit organisation, the organisation I represent is a Laundry service which washes clothes for our poor and disadvantaged South African.
I have added web pages to my website with codes I got off the internet, Im referring to codes i have gotten from youtube, and other internet sources With these codes.
I have managed to create my Homepage which has the logo picture presented at the top below the title of the page,the page explains what the organisation is about,an About Us page which explains what we are about ,how our services work etc.The organisation's Mission, vision and goals. A service page which shows what our services are and how we actually operate. An enquiry page where our online clients can enquire about something they are not sure about. Than finally a Contact Us page where we display our contact details which include our Phone number,email, whatsapp, and Instagram for now.
